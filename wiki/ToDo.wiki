== BUG ==





== Todo ==

	- Page ordering needed for subpages
	- Member details in memberlist
	- Group core module (including all/registered) or inside member core module?
	- Check all module with group access
	- Member registration
	- News module





== Done ==
16/07/2008
- File image upload in page

8.42 13/07/2008
- Check all admin level in all modules

8.57 06/07/2008

- Admin manager
- Blocks like in solaitra
	* Block library
	* Browse for block file for each module
	* in that file $this->block->set('blockname', 'callback_function')
	* in views $this->block->get('blockname', $params=array(name =>value));

That means, area.1 etc should be removed.
