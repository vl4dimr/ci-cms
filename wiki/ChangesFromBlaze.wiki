# What was changed from blaze

= Introduction =

These are the things that I changed from blaze.

= Changes =
  * *Loader* I just use the matchbox library to load modules
  * *views* To load a view in modules is now like the normal load view in CI
  * *area* there can be more content from one or more modules in one area. In blaze one area is for one content
  * *theme* Themes are now put together under application/views, for example all files about the default theme is not in the default directory (statics etc...)
  * *theme* I changed also the directory structure of the theme
  * *views* Views in each module also have a slightly different structure
