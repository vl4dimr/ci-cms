## BUG ##





## Todo ##

> - Page ordering needed for subpages
> - Member details in memberlist
> - Group core module (including all/registered) or inside member core module?
> - Check all module with group access
> - Member registration
> - News module





## Done ##
16/07/2008
- File image upload in page

8.42 13/07/2008
- Check all admin level in all modules

8.57 06/07/2008

- Admin manager
- Blocks like in solaitra
  * Block library
  * Browse for block file for each module
  * in that file $this->block->set('blockname', 'callback\_function')
  * in views $this->block->get('blockname', $params=array(name =>value));

That means, area.1 etc should be removed.
