This project is a tentative to create a modular CMS using [Codeigniter](http://codeigniter.com). Part of it comes from [Blaze](http://blaze.haughin.com). Later I adjusted it to fit my way of thinking from my former CMS [Solaitra](https://sourceforge.net/projects/solaitra)

It uses Matchbox to make it modular. Modules can be removed and added.

Each theme is in one folder so that it can be added as packs.


Please submit any issues.

## Compatibility with CodeIgniter 2 ##

We are upgrading CI-CMS to be compatible with Codeigniter 2. It is hosted for some reasons in Bitbucket.org https://bitbucket.org/hery/ci-cms/ and it is in a pre-Alfa release

Please download and test and report issues

Thanks
